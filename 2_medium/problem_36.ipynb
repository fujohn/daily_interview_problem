    "An in-order traversal of the binary search tree would give us all the nodes of the tree in sorted order. So the naive solution here might be do an in-order traversal of the tree, store it in an array, and return the second-to-last element in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "This takes O(N) time and space since we have to go through and store every node in the tree.\n",
