    "The brute force solution is here to try every possible permutation of moves and see if they're valid. That would be pretty much computationally infeasible, since we have N * N possible spots. That would be N^2!\n",

    "We can improve the performance on this using backtracking, similar to the N queen problem (#38) or the flight itinerary problem (#41). The basic idea is this:\n",
    "\n",

    "We'll represent the tour as just a sequence of tuples (r, c). To speed things up and to avoid having to look at the whole tour to check whether a space has been used before, we can create an N by N board to mark whether we've seen it already."
