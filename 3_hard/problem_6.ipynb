    "An XOR linked list is a more memory efficient doubly linked list. Instead of each node holding next and prev fields, it holds a field named both, which is an XOR of the next node and the previous node. Implement an XOR linked list; it has an add(element) which adds the element to the end, and a get(index) which returns the node at index.\n",

Then, given a node, to go to the next node, we have to XOR the current node's both with the previous node's address. And to handle getting the next node from the head, we would initialize the previous node's address as 0.\n",
