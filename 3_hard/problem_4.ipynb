    "Our lives would be easier without the linear time constraint: we would just sort the array, while filtering out negative numbers, and iterate over the sorted array and return the first number that doesn't match the index. However, sorting takes O(n log n), so we can't use that here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly we have to use some sort of trick here to get it running in linear time. Since the first missing positive number must be between 1 and len(array) + 1 (why?), we can ignore any negative numbers and numbers bigger than len(array). The basic idea is to use the indices of the array itself to reorder the elements to where they should be. We traverse the array and swap elements between 0 and the length of the array to their value's index. We stay at each index until we find that index's value and keep on swapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this process, all the first positive numbers should be grouped in order at the beginning of the array. We don't care about the others. This only takes O(N) time, since we swap each element at most once.\n",
