Then, we create an empty dictionary to represent our parsed file system and traverse the file system on each entry. We keep track of the last path we've seen so far in current_path because we may need to return to some level in that path, depending on the number of tabs. Once we are at the correct place to put down the new directory or file, we check the name for a . and set the correct value to either True (if file) or {} (if directory).\n",

And if there are no paths starting at this root, then we can simply return the empty string.\n",
