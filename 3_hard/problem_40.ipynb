    "We can find the unique number in an array of two duplicates by XORing all the numbers in the array. What this does is cancel out all the bits that have an even number of 1s, leaving only the unique (odd) bits out.\n",

    "Let's assume all integers fit in 32 bits. Then let's create an array 32 zeroes long, and when iterating over each number in our array, we can add up all the bits to its proper spot in the array. Finally, we'll go over each bit in the array and make it equal to itself modulo 3. This means that any bit that has been set some multiple of 3 times will effectively be cleared, leaving only the bit from the unique number."
